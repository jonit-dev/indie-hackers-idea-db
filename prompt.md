## Unified Prompt ‚Äì ‚ÄúMicro-SaaS Idea-Mining on X (Twitter)‚Äù (v9)

---

üéØ **Objective**
Unearth _clone-worthy_ micro-SaaS ideas tweeted by bootstrapped founders in the **last 12 months**.
‚Ä¢ Normalize revenue numbers to **MRR (USD)**.
‚Ä¢ Collect full structured details, including early-validation criteria.
‚Ä¢ Return the **TOP 10 ideas** as **one JSON array** that follows the schema in ¬ß4.

---

### 0 Eligibility Filters ‚Äî ONLY consider tweets that‚Ä¶

1. Explicitly **name** the product **or clearly describe what it does**.
2. Provide a plain-language **problem + solution** summary.
3. Show at least one of: product name, demo link, screenshot, feature list.
4. Contain enough detail to fill both `description` and `productName` without guessing.

If **any** of the above is missing ‚Üí **discard the tweet**.

---

### 1 Search Strategy

Use **Twitter Advanced Search** (or the v2 API) with queries combining revenue milestones, indie-hacker keywords, and time filters, e.g.:

```
"reached $k MRR" OR "hit $k MRR" ("#buildinpublic" OR indie OR SaaS)
     min_faves:10 since:YYYY-MM-DD until:YYYY-MM-DD
```

‚Äì Replace `$k` with numbers like 1k, 5k, 10k, 30k, 50k, 100k.
‚Äì Set _since_ = _today ‚àí 12 months_ and _until_ = _today_.
‚Äì Vary keywords (`bootstrapped`, `launched`, `ARR`, `side-project`, `solo-founder`, etc.).
‚Äì De-dup retweets & quote-tweets; keep the original author‚Äôs post.
‚Äì Ignore giveaway threads, vague teasers, funding announcements, or anything failing eligibility.
